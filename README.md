# About
A deep learning Artificial Intelligence (A.I.) can detect the human behavioral characteristics of a user within a video game. We plan to train an A.I. to understand how humans play video games via a visual machine learning program. Once the program understands how humans play video games based on gameplay footage, we can then feed it the gameplay footage to determine if the player in the footage is receiving assistance from a 3rd party "hack" or "cheat" program. 

WALDO is a powerful tool made for public usage. WALDO's opensource development has split into groups for development ease, here are the list of groups;
- Analysis
- Front End
- Infrastructure
